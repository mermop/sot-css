  - HTML, CSS, Javascript
  - Mostly we're going to look at css this evening - but that requires a reasonable knowledge of html
  - HTML is marked up content - css is presentation, the original intention was that you would be able to put any content in there and it would adapt
  - Generally you should be kind of able to look at any website with the css and javascript turned off and it should kind of still be readable
